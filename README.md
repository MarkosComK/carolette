# carolette ✨
> The exact same as **Moulinette** but entirely different.

#### 🚧 Work In Progress 🚧
* For now, it's just a `libft tester`.


I’m learning how to build my own tests for my 42 projects, so I’ll be updating this repo with new features as I go. <br>
It’s a personal project, and I’m having fun building it.

## Plug and play:
1. Clone the repo to your home directory:
   
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:carolcortes/carolette.git
   ```

3. Create the alias:
   
   ```bash
   ~/carolette/plug.sh && exec "$SHELL"
   ```

4. Run the command `carolette` inside your libft folder:
   
   ```bash
   carolette
   ```

## Unplug? Why on earth you would want to uninstall this magnificent tool?
Ok, whatever. It's not a complex tool, you just have to run the following command to remove the `carolette` alias and the GitHub repo:
   
   ```bash
   ~/carolette/unplug.sh && cd ~ && rm -fr carolette && exec "$SHELL"
   ```
